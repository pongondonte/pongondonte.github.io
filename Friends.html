<ul>
<li>1. Roisin</li>
<li>2. Campbell</li>
<li>3. Lachlan</li>
<li>4. Clay</li>
<li>5. Joe</li>
</ul>

<p>This list was difficult to write, but this is how it turned out.</p>
<p>Joe is at 5 because I feel we've been losing touch.</p>
<p>Clay is at 4 for the same reason as Joe.</p>
<p>Lachan is at 3 because he's funny and we still talk often.</p>
<p>Campbell is at 2 because as good a friend as he is, he's not as good as number 1.</p>
<p>Roisin is at 1 because she's funny, nice to talk to and overall an incredible friend.</p>
